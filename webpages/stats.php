				<h3>Codecracker 2010 Stats</h3>
				<div class="left_box">
				<p align="justify"><strong>Codecracker '10</strong> was a major success among the three seasons of codecracker. We went ahead to support four programming languages C, C++, Java and Python. This time we broke all the records of the past with the number of registered teams exponentially rising to 195, with teams from over 40 engineering colleges including several IITs, IIITs, NITs and others.

Though many teams did not turn up to solve even a single question, may be because they were too difficult for them. Teams from IIITs outperformed everyone. 
Active meter showed 5500+ page loads.
