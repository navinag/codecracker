An astrologer has suggested Shreyank to number his house with digits whose multiples sum up to another multiple of that number. Like 3, if you take any multiple of 3, 118*3=354 and 3+5+4=12,which is a multiple of 3. Such digits are called holy digits. Shreyank being an engineer wanted to satisfy himself and the astrologer, he thought if a digit is not holy in base 10 it could be holy in another base.

Shreyank has appointed you to help him in this task. Given a base you are required to print all the holy digits in that base.

Note : For checking the digit to be holy multiples fewer than 4 digits only need to be checked. In base 10 multiples greater than 999 need not be considered. (1 and 0 are not considered holy).

Input format
First line will contain the the number of test cases N(less than 100), followed by N lines containing base B (3<=B<=30).

Output format
Output N lines containing holy digits in increasing order, seperated by spaces, and a space after the last digit.

Example
Input : 
4
10
3
9
26

Output : 
3 9
2
2 4 8
5 25
