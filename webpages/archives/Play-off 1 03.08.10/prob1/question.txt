Debayan is very fond of Linux and likes Linux Words a lot. A Linux Word is a word that consists of only the letters L, I, N, U, and X in that exact relative order. There must be exactly one L, exactly one I, one or more Ns, exactly one U and exactly one X. Case does not matter. For example, "Linux", "Linnnux" are linux words, whereas "Llinux", "Linuxx" are not.

You are given a String word which you must turn into a Linux Word. For each character in word, you can either replace it with a different letter or leave it unchanged. No other operations, like inserting new characters or deleting existing characters, are allowed. Printing the minimal number of characters you must replace to get a Linux Word. If it's impossible, return -1.

Input format: 
First line will be the number of testcases N, the following N lines will contain N words without any space.

Output format: 
N lines printing the desired output.
