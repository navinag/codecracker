Print the number of ways Rajat can assign numbers to his coins, modulo 1,000,000,007. If it's impossible to assign distinct integers to the coins, print 0.

Example : If the value of the coins are 4,4,4,4. All permutations of {1,2,3,4} are possible, so answer is 24.

Input format :
First line will contain the number of test cases N, followed by N lines containing the value of the favourite coins.
