Roshan likes to play with numbers a lot, given a sequence of numbers he was keen in finding the longest "Crooked sub-sequence".
A sequence is Crooked if the difference between consequtive numbers alternate between positive and negative.
Example : 2,10,3,5,4 is a Crooked sequence, because the differences (8,-7,2,-1) are alternatively positive and negative.

Given a sequence of integers return the length of the longest sub-sequence of sequence that is a crooked sequence. 

Input format: 
First line will be the number of testcases N, the following N lines will contain N sequences.

Output format: 
N lines printing the length of each longest Crooked sub-sequence

Example :
