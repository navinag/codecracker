Swapnil discovered a new dice game, where five dices are used. Your task is to calculate the score in the first phase of Swapnil's game. The score is determined by the values on the upward die faces after a roll. Then the player chooses a value, and all the dice showing those values are considered active. The score is simply the summation of the values on active dice.

For example, the player rolls the 5 dices and gets the values 2,2,3,5 and 4. Choosing the value 2 makes the dice showing 2 active and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 makes the one die showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.

Given the values of the 5 dices after they are rolled, print the maximal possible score with these values.
