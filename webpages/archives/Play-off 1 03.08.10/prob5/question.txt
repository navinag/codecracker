									Existence

The year is 4139 A.D. Humanity now resides in a planet named Kainan. So far there exists K settlements, some of them connected with one-way channels.

The Chancellor of Kainan has decided to establish SWAT in his planet. The cost of building a SWAT station in each settlement is given. However, there may not be a need to build the same in every settlement. The only requirement is that every settlement must be reachable from some station using channels.

As the next elections are approaching, the chancellor doesn't want to expose large SWAT expenses. Thus he wants the average cost of a built station to be as low as possible.


INPUT: T, the number of test cases. Each test cases begins with K, the no. of settlements (maximum of 50). It is followed by a line containing K positive integers, where ith integer represents the cost of building SWAT station in the settlement i. This line is followed by a KxK matrix M, representing the channel layout. If M[i][j] is 'Y', implies that there is a channel from settlement i to j, and 'N' implies there is not.

OUTPUT: T lines each printing the lowest average possible average cost (6 decimal places) of building SWAT stations in the given scenario case.
