Installation
==================

Dependency:
===========
Python 2.6
PHP
Python bindings for Mysql
JDK preferably SUN JDK, openJDK will also work
GCC, G++

Webpages:
=========
Copy all the files in webpages directory to the document root of your apache installation. Usually '/var/www/html' for Fedora or Red Hat, '/srv/www/htdocs' for openSUSE, '/var/www' for Ubuntu.

Now copy the dbconnect.sample.php to dbconnect.php and change the variables accordingly. set $user as your Mysql database user, $password as the password of the Mysql database user $database as the name of the database and $host as the name of the mysql host, leave unchanged if the database is on the same machine.

Also give write permission to chat.txt.
If not sure what to do, run this command as root

# chmod a+w chat.txt

Now create the tables in database with the codecracker.sql file in the sql directory. If the name of the database is codecracker run this command to create the database

$ mysql -u root -p codecracker < codecracker.sql

and enter password when prompted.

Configuration:
==============
Copy the codecracker directory in the config directory to /usr/local/ and give it write permission for the user who will run the codecracker.py. Anyways

# chmod -R a+w /usr/local/codecracker 

would do, though not recommended. Use questionnaire directory to put the questions. They are plain text files, prob1.txt for problem 1 and so on. Similarly put judge answer in judge_answer directory as ans1.txt and judge input in judge_input direcotry as in1.txt. Follow the same naming convention.

Set the various configuration values in codecracker.conf file. They are self explanatory, they will be used by the engine.

Main Engine:
============
The codecracker.py in src directory is the engine. The codecrakcer engine consists of a single python file. It uses codecracker.conf for the various configuration. It can be run from anywhere and by any user. However running as root is not recommended.

Our program was written in Python 2.6. We do not know if it is compatible with other versions.
For java, openJDK can be used however using SUN JDK is recommended. If you find Java not working search for java and javac in codecracker.py and replace with absolute paths.

You can use update-alternatives to change the default java and javac if you have multiple JDK installed.
